Introduction
===============

Escape from Starsector is a vertically scrolling, arcade-style evasion game written in Python 3.4.
The game is rare in that, despite controlling an advanced ship in a space combat environment, 
the player does not have any offensive capabilities. The current and future abilities of the 
ship will all be defensive in nature, with core gameplay focused on keeping up resource 
reserves (eg energy) and using the ship's various defences at the best times. The game currently
features only two enemies and two defensive abilities, with a single resource to manage. 
Future releases with greatly expand all of these areas. Oh, and I'll throw in some sort of 
storyline too.

The game is currently in development, with an alpha release set for mid-October.
