Gameplay
==========



The goal of the game is to escape the enemy forces and reach
friendly lines. As your capitan is a dyed-in-the-wool pacifist who refuses to use the ship's 
offensive capabilities, you must evade or absorb all incoming attacks to survive. 

- Use the arrow keys to move the ship around the screen
- Use the d and a keys to charge and sap your shield, respectively. 
- Use the w key to drain your energy to temporariliy overcharge your engines for a speed boost. 

Charging the shield takes energy from the reactor reserve, while lowering your shield boosts the energy reservoir.

Your ship has a powerful shield but a weak hull. Any damage to the
ship itself will be lethal.
