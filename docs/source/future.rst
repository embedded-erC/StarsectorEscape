Future Directions
==================

General Additions:
-------------------
- First, storyline. It's not going to be RPG-levels, but right now there is exactly zero. 
- Sound. This proved to be a bridge too far to be completed by presentation time
- Multiple modes. An arcade insane survival mode in addition to the normal gameplay would be nice.
- Damage to specific parts of the ship. At the moment, any hull shot is lethal. I'd like to add in 
hitbox-specific effects and damage to subsystems. 

Future Ship Capabilities:
--------------------------
There are almost too many ways to go in this direction. Some abilities that I would definitely 
like to add are:

- Cloaking: Spend a large amount of energy to become untargetable
- Warp jump: Advance the current screen by a large amount. Effectively clearing the screen of enemies
without using some offensive nuke-like weapon.
- More involved engine management
- A dodge: A short term ability (active for only a couple of frames, long cooldown) that ignores the next
damage taken
- Some sort of 'slow': A pilot hyper awareness or a time distortion that slows everything on the 
screen for a short time.  


Future Enemies:
----------------
Nothing specific in mind here, though the amount of ship artwork I have gives me almost too many options. I 
would like maybe half a dozen more small fighters, then an assortment of frigates, cruisers, and capital ships.
I also like the idea of enemy support ships - ships that boost the abilities of enemy ships (or give them new abilities 
entirely).
