# StarsectorEscape
Repo for Python300 final project 
This repo contains the source files and documentation for the very much in development Escape from Starsector.

This game was programmed in python3.4. It has not yet been tested in other environments. 
It also requires the pygame package to run. Unfortunately, pygame must be downloaded manually (at least the version used for this game). The version of pygame used to create the game is in the repo. Other versions of pygame can be found at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame
